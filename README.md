# **Spatial Analysis on Covid-19**

## **Introduction**
**Geospatial data science** is a subset of data science that focuses on **spatial data** and its unique techniques. **Spatial analysis** is a type of geographical analysis which seeks to explain patterns of human behavior and its spatial expression in terms of geometry and mathematics, that is, locational analysis.

Spatial analysis allows to solve complex location-oriented problems and better understand where and what is occurring in the world. It goes beyond mere mapping to let you study the characteristics of places and the relationships between them. Spatial analysis lends new perspectives to  decision-making.

## **Libraries Used:** 
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Processing Libraries: Numpy (v1.18.5), Pandas (v1.1.2)
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geopython Libraries: Geopy, Plotly (v4.4.1)
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib (v3.2.2)

## **Covid-19 Data Details**
The dataset used in this project is taken from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/covid-19/master/data/countries-aggregated.csv'.
Reason to consider this data set is that it keeps on updating. And the features of the dataset are as follows:
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data (object)
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Country (object)
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirmed (int64)
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovered (int64)
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death (int64)

## **Takeaways from this Project:**
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation for a career in Geospatial Data Science.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduces you to the most essential Geopython Libraries.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn how to pre-process geospatial data.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perform Geocoding on Data
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spatial Visuals like Choropleth, Geographical Scatter plot, Geographical Heatmap, Markers, Geographical HeatMap.
